## About The Project

https://github.com/MrWilliamA/Wordle-Like-App

I wanted to do something a little different for my javascript App project. I have always been a fan of online games and decided to have a go at recreating one of my favorites, currently takinghte world by storm. Wordle.

I gave it my own crative spin and decided not to look at the original game at all during the build. I wanted this to me a project of my own.

The app works by fetching a a random word from the Words API and cmparing the user inputs to th randomly genereated word. Player scores can be saved to a local JSON file and ordered by date.

### Built With

Worlde-Like App was build with vanilla Javascript, CSS, HTML, a freely available <a href="https://www.wordsapi.com/">Words API</a> and a local JSON server. I also used  <a href="https://trello.com/b/7MYi54dC/wordle-like-app">Trello</a> to keep track of my to-dos and flag any bugs that needed attention.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Playing the game

Playing is easy. Simply select the first input field (top left corner) and start guessing words. Each time you type a letter your cursor will automatically move to the next input so you can just keep typing. 

Once you have written your guess, hit enter on the keyboard and you will notice two things happen. Firstly your cursor is on the second row, ready for your next guess. Secondly the first row will now be colour coded; green if the letter was correct, red if its wrong, and yellow if the letter is write but in the wrong spot. This will give you a clue on what word to guess next.

The aim of the game is to guess the word before you run out of rows. You get one point per row ( the less points the better) and only six guesses. This makes the best score 1, and the worst score 6. If you don't guess the word in time you fail and get zero points.
